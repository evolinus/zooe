I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Department of Biology and Biotechnology](https://dbb.dip.unipv.it/it) of the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it).
I have a background in evolutionary biology and a broad interest towards evolutionary genomics. During my MSc studies in Biodiversity and Evolution at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it), I had the chance to carry out an internship in the [Simakov group](https://neurodevbio.univie.ac.at/simakov-research/) in Vienna. This further sparked my interest in transposable elements and their impact on genomic architecture.  
I carried out a PhD at the [Insitute of Evolutionary Sciences of Montpellier](https://isem-evolution.fr/en/), where I was co-supervised by [Benoit Nabholz](https://sites.google.com/site/benoitnabholz/), [Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier](https://annasfistonlavier.com/) and [Annabelle Haudry](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/fr/annuaires-des-membres/haudry-annabelle). My PhD project revolved around the impact of genetic drift on genome size size variation and transposable elements proliferation in animal genomes.  
At the zoo_e lab, I focus on the characterization of transposable elements under thermal stress in *Aedes albopictus*: the main goal is to understand whether polymorphic transposable elements can be involved into recent adaptations in the italian populations of tiger mosquitoes.
