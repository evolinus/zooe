I hold the position of Associate Professor of Zoology at the [Department of Biology and Biotechnology](https://dbb.dip.unipv.it/en) of the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it). My research interests are aimed at better understanding the origin of adaptive traits in insects (& friends) using population genetics and molecular evolution approaches. I grew up with a keen interest in animals and I like to think of myself as a zoologist with a sweep net in one hand and a genome in the other. 
After graduating in Biology from the [University of Padova](https://www.biologia.unipd.it/), I obtained my Ph.D. in Natural Sciences from the [Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich](https://evol.bio.lmu.de/) under the supervision of [Wolfgang Stephan](https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/people/professor_emeritus/stephan_w/index.html). I then studied the evolution of gene expression in ants in [Laurent Keller](https://laurentkeller.ch/en/home/)'s lab at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html). 
You can find my full CV [here](https://evolinus.github.io/zooe/pdfs/LinoOmetto.CV.pdf).

I have always enjoyed sharing my passion and interests with students and people in general, and I am regularly involved in [outreach initiatives](https://evolinus.github.io/zooe/teaching/).

I am president of the [Italian Society for Evolutionary Biology](https://www.sibe-iseb.it/).

My research interests are aimed at better understanding the origin of adaptive traits in insects (& friends). I like to think of myself as a zoologist with a sweep net in one hand and a genome in the other. I grew up with a keen interest in animals and have embraced the power of population genetics and molecular evolution as a means of uncovering the genetic basis of ecologically relevant traits. 
I have been fortunate to experience a variety of educational and research contexts, both in terms of cultural diversity and of research fields. After receiving a  MSc in Biology from the [University of Padova](https://www.biologia.unipd.it/) (and one year at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/)) I worked as research assistant at the [Max Plank Institute for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en) and at the [School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/academic-study/science/science-schools-and-departments/school-of-biological-sciences). Fascinated with population genetics, I obtained my Ph.D. in Natural Sciences from the [Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich](https://evol.bio.lmu.de/) under the supervision of [Wolfgang Stephan](https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/people/professor_emeritus/stephan_w/index.html). I then studied the evolution of gene expression in ants in [Laurent Keller](https://laurentkeller.ch/en/home/)'s lab at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html), and finally moved back to Italy to [Fondazione Edmund Mach](https://cri.fmach.it/en/).
I have always enjoyed sharing my passion and interests with students and people in general, and I am regularly involved in outreach initiatives.
