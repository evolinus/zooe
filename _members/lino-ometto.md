I currently hold the position of Associate Professor of Zoology, and I enjoy both teaching and research. I have been fortunate to encounter a variety of educational and research contexts, both in terms of cultural diversity and of research fields. After obtaining a  MSc in Biology from the [University of Padua](https://www.biologia.unipd.it/), I spent one year as reserach assistant, first at the Max-Plank Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen (now [MPI for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en)) working on nectarivorous bats with [York Winter](https://www.winterlab.org/teamlist/winter/), then at the [School of Biological Sciences of the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/academic-study/science/science-schools-and-departments/school-of-biological-sciences) and [Maud Island](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/te-pakeka-maud-island/) working on chemichal behaviour in _Leiopelma pakeka_ frogs with [Bruce Waldman](https://experts.okstate.edu/bruce.waldman/about). I then got facinated by population genetics, and attained my PhD in Natural Sciences at the [Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich](https://evol.bio.lmu.de/) under the supervision of [Wolfgang Stephan](https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/people/professor_emeritus/stephan_w/index.html). I then studied the evoution of gene expression in ants in [Laurent Keller](https://laurentkeller.ch/en/home/)'s lab at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html), and finally moved back to Italy at the research institute [Fondazione Edmund Mach](https://cri.fmach.it/en/). Before settling in Pavia I even enjoyed two year as middle- and high-schools science teacher.
