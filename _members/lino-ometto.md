I currently hold the position of Associate Professor of Zoology, and I enjoy both teaching and research. I have been fortunate to encounter a variety of educational and research contexts, both in terms of cultural diversity and of research fields. After receiving a  MSc in Biology from the [University of Padua](https://www.biologia.unipd.it/), I spent a year as a research assistant, first at the Max Plank Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen (now the [MPI for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en)) working with [York Winter](https://www.winterlab.org/teamlist/winter/) on nectarivorous bats, then at the [School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/academic-study/science/science-schools-and-departments/school-of-biological-sciences) and [Maud Island](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/marlborough/places/te-pakeka-maud-island/) working with [Bruce Waldman](https://experts.okstate.edu/bruce.waldman/about) on chemical behaviour in _Leiopelma pakeka_ frogs. Becoming fascinated with population genetics, I obtained my Ph.D. in Natural Sciences from the [Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich](https://evol.bio.lmu.de/) under the supervision of [Wolfgang Stephan](https://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/people/professor_emeritus/stephan_w/index.html). I then studied the evolution of gene expression in ants in [Laurent Keller](https://laurentkeller.ch/en/home/)'s lab at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html), and finally moved back to Italy to the research institute [Fondazione Edmund Mach](https://cri.fmach.it/en/). Before settling in Pavia, I even enjoyed two years as a middle and high school science teacher.
