Hi everyone, I’m Vani! I’ve always been fascinated by animals, the human body, and the complex interplay of genetics that underlies life. As a child, I was the kind of person who’d ask “why?” at every turn — curious about everything. 

I pursued by BSc in Canada, and now, since starting my Master’s degree here in Pavia, I’ve become particularly interested in the use of bioinformatics for big data analysis. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking huge, seemingly chaotic datasets and turning them into meaningful insights.

Right now, my thesis focuses on reconstructing the phylogeny of Diptera using multiple bioinformatic pipelines.

Outside of school, I love to run, swim, hike, and watch animal documentaries!
