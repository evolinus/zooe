Hi everyone! I'm Giulia! I'm passionate about reading and science. Ever since I was little, I’ve had a knack for capturing every tiny critter I could find, keeping them in jars and bringing them home as "pets"—much to my mom's dismay. These days, my interests have shifted toward evolution and bioinformatics: there’s nothing quite like the thrill of seeing my code run smoothly, free of those dreaded red error lines!  

Right now, my thesis project focuses on the population genetics of *Formica paralugubris*. Our goal is to achieve a spatial and temporal comparison of the genome of this fascinating species!
