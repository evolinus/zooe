Hi everyone, I’m Chiara! Ever since I was young, I’d always be in awe at the little critters that would quickly hide in the shallow water of a pond if I would get too close to it. It was mesmerizing to me (and it still is, to be fair!) how extraordinarily interesting such small creatures could be. After a BSc in Biology (where I could get a glimpse of the wonders and mysteries of life) at the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it) I pursued a MSc in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/it): while genes transformed into codes on my computer screen I discovered just how much I liked how the “bio” and the “informatics” would complement each other in order to make sense out of complicated biological data. During my MSc I also had the privilege of staying at the [Max Planck Institute for Biology of Tübingen](https://www.bio.mpg.de/2923/en) under the supervision of [Christian Rödelsperger](https://sommerlab.org/research/evolutionary-genomics-and-bioinformatics.html).  
Currently my PhD project revolves around transposable elements in *Aedes albopictus* (the dreaded asian tiger mosquito): we want to see if and how thermal stress is responsible for an increase in their transposition activity, thus possibly providing mosquitoes with enhanced adaptive capabilities.  
Besides mosquitoes, I am deeply interested in eco-evo-devo and population genetics and in my free time I like to organize events, paint, read a lot of books and learn more about other very cool organisms (like ants and tunicates!).
