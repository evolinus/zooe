I am a last-year BSc student in Biological Sciences at the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it). My research (and also my thesis project) is currently focused on understanding the evolutionary and demographic history of *Drosophila melanogaster* in Europe, leveraging a wide set of tools and concepts borrowed from Biostatistics, Population Genomics and Bioinformatics. I've always been interested in Science and Evolution, and I decided to merge this interest with my strong passion for coding and building software, diving into Bioinformatics.
