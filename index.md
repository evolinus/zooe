# Zoology and Evolution

The **zoo**<span style="color:#e30022">**_**</span><span style="color:#ffbf00">**e**</span> lab (*laboratorio di Zoologia ed Evoluzione*) is headed by [Lino Ometto](https://evolinus.github.io/zooe/members/lino-ometto.html), at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://dbb.dip.unipv.it/en) of the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it).  
We study the genetic basis of biodiversity with a combination of computational and experimental approaches. We use molecular evolution and population genetics to characterize the neutral and selective processes that underly phenotypic and adaptive traits in natural insect populations (and other animals).

Can transposable elements provide adaptive variation in invading mosquitoes?  
How have the populations of introduced ants evolved in the newly established areas?  
And other stories.

Our research, also in collaboration with colleagues in Italy and abroad, has led to the discovery of new insights into the processes and mechanisms that accompany the evolution of insects and other organisms.
