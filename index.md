# Zoology and Evolution

The **zoo_e** lab is at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://dbb.dip.unipv.it/en) of the [University of Pavia](https://portale.unipv.it/it).  
We study the genetic basis of biodiversity with a combination of computational and experimental approaches.

Can transposable elements provide adaptive variation in invading mosquitoes?  
What happened to introduced ant populations?  
And other stories.

We use molecular evolution and population genetics to characterize the neutral and selective processes that underly phenotypic and adaptive traits in natural populations of in insects and other organisms.
