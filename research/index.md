# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Research Projects

In the **zoo_e** lab, we mainly use comparative approaches to study the genetic basis of adaptation and evolution in animals. Insects are the main group of organisms we study (because they are fantastic), but we also enjoy studying other animals. We have ongoing collaborations with research groups in Italy and abroad, providing a constant flow of ideas, new skills and abilities, passion and enthusiasm.
