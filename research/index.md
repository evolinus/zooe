In the **zoo**<span style="color:#e30022">**_**</span><span style="color:#ffbf00">**e**</span> lab, we mainly use comparative approaches to study the genetic basis of adaptation and evolution in animals. Insects are the main group of organisms we study (because they are fantastic), but we also enjoy studying other animals. The **zoo_e lab** works in close contact with the other groups in our department working on the [genomics of insects of agricultural and medical importance](https://dbb.dip.unipv.it/en/research/research-teams-and-topics/genomics-and-biotechnology-insects-agricultural-and-sanitary) based in our department. We also have ongoing collaborations with research groups in Italy and abroad, providing a constant flow of ideas, new skills and abilities, passion and enthusiasm.
