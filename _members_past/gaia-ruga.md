Hello everyone! I'm Gaia and I've always been fascinated by the animal world. My passion for ethology and biodiversity conservation has led me to research how human intervention can help endangered species. My dissertation project focuses on the effectiveness of *Salmo marmoratus* restocking using Vibert boxes in a small subalpine stream. This research aims to assess how well this method contributes to the survival of this iconic species in its natural habitat and is carried out with [Pietro Volta](https://www.irsa.cnr.it/wp/?page_id=1168&author=pietro.volta) at the [Water Research Institute (IRSA-CNR)](https://www.irsa.cnr.it/wp/?page_id=807&lang=en) of Verbania. I'm looking forward to delving deeper into this topic and contributing to meaningful conservation efforts!
