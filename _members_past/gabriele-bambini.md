Hi, I'm Gabriele, a Master student in Biomedical Sciences and an intern at the **zoo**<span style="color:#e30022">**_**</span><span style="color:#ffbf00">**e**</span> lab.  
My interests span the entire field of biomedical sciences, but nothing captivates me more than genetics. The opportunity to explore the "code of life" and its evolution is a unique chance to make a small but meaningful contribution to scientific progress. After graduation, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to further explore the many facets of this fascinating discipline.  
I see the computational approach as both the present and the future of genetics, a powerful tool to handle the immense amount of data generated by high-throughput techniques and to enable in-depth analysis of the secrets of the genome.  
The focus of my thesis is the identification of transposon activity in the tiger mosquito *Aedes albopictus* following the induction of thermal stress.
